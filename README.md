 NFT preview card component
This is a project from the Frontendmentor site. It is 99% operational because on hover the view icon is displayed. The color of the icon must be white to be completely visible. This is not completely the case for my project but it remains visible all the same. I will still look for what I may have forgotten in my code and I will update it.
